These are the built Visual Studio outputs from assimp 5.2.5 (from September 12th, 2023)

VS22vc143x64sharedDLL: lib + DLL
VS22vc143x64static: just lib (no DLL)  <-- I'm using this one
VS22vc143x64staticCRT: just lib and static VS Run-time

There is a VS project called "assimp_example" in the VS22vc143x64static folder. 
It's just the example from the assimp page, but has the librarys, folders, etc. set up. 

Enjoy,

Michael
